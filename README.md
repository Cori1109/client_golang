# Overview
This is the [Prometheus](http://www.prometheus.io)
[Go](http://golang.org) client library.  It provides several distinct
functions, and there is separate documentation for each respective
component.  You will want to select the appropriate topic below to
continue your journey:

  1. See the [exposition library](prometheus/README.md) if you want to
     export metrics to a Prometheus server or pushgateway

  2. See the [consumption library](extraction/README.md) if you want to
     process metrics exported by a Prometheus client. (The Prometheus server
     is using that library.)
